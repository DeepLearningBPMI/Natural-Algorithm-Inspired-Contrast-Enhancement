# Natural-Algorithm-Inspired-Contrast-Enhancement
This repository contains the implementation of image contrast enhancement techniques using a hybrid approach that integrates Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Simulated Annealing (SA). The algorithms have been designed to improve the visual quality of images by enhancing their contrast.
